- Fix the node tests
- Refactor the logging subsystem
    - Lots of repeated code (for basically every class that uses logging)
    - Unable to log to a file
- Implement resync between nodes
- Maybe implement some sort of heartbeat between the beacon and the nodes
    - Or drop peers from the local node peerlist after too many "host unreachable" errors
- Use list[Peer] in cpos.p2p.network? Or at least find a way to pretty-print the peer IDs
